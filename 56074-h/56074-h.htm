<div class="center">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">In Arcady there lies a crystal spring</div>
<div class="i0">Ring'd all about with green melodious reeds</div>
<div class="i0">Swaying seal'd music up and down the wind.</div>
<div class="i0">Here on its time-defac√®d pedestal</div>
<div class="i0">The image of a half-forgotten God</div>
<div class="i0">Crumbles to its complete oblivion.</div>
<div class="i0">The faithful and invariable earth</div>
<div class="i0">Tilts at the shrine her sacrificial cup,</div>
<div class="i0">Spilling libations from the brim that runs</div>
<div class="i0">The golden nectar of her daffodils</div>
<div class="i0">And rivulets of summer-breathing flow'rs.</div>
<div class="i0">O evanescent temples built of man</div>
<div class="i0">To deities he honoured and dethroned!</div>
<div class="i0">Earth shoots a trail of her eternal vine</div>
<div class="i0">To crown the head that men have ceased to honour.</div>
<div class="i0">Beneath the coronal of leaf and lichen</div>
<div class="i0">The mocking smile upon the lips derides</div>
<div class="i0">Pan's lost dominion; but the pointed ears</div>
<div class="i0">Are keen and prick'd with old remember'd sounds.</div>
<div class="i0">All my breast aches with longing for the past!</div>
<div class="i0">Thou God of stone, I have a craving in me</div>
<div class="i0">For knowledge of thee as thou wert in old</div>
<div class="i0">Enchanted twilights in Arcadia.</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
<div class="i0">Arcadia! it is the very music</div>
<div class="i0">Of the first spring-tide rippling its first wave</div>
<div class="i0">Over the naked, laughing baby world ...</div>
<div class="i0">Come again, thou sparkling spring-tide, come again,</div>
<div class="i0">Rush in and flood this autumn from my soul!</div>
<div class="i0">These waters welling at a dead God's shrine,</div>
<div class="i0">These happy waters bubbling limpid kisses,</div>
<div class="i0">Even with such bright and eager lips made wet</div>
<div class="i0">The hem of the earth's garment in the days</div>
<div class="i0">When earth was youthful and the Gods of Greece</div>
<div class="i0">In starry constellation crowned Olympus.</div>
<div class="i0">What drifting mists have veil'd the Olympian fires?</div>
<div class="i0">What of the Gods of Greece? and what of Greece?</div>
<div class="i0">O virgin Greece, standing with naked feet</div>
<div class="i0">In the morning dews of the world against the light</div>
<div class="i0">Of an infant dawn! old Greece, ever-young Greece,</div>
<div class="i0">The pagan in my blood, the instinct in me</div>
<div class="i0">That yearns back, back to nature-worship, cries</div>
<div class="i0">Aloud to thee! I would stoop to kiss those feet,</div>
<div class="i0">Sweet white wet feet washed with the earth's first dews:&mdash;</div>
<div class="i0">And leaning ear to grass I would re-catch</div>
<div class="i0">Echoes of footsteps sounding down dim ages</div>
<div class="i0">For ever the music once they made on thee:</div>
<div class="i0">The flaming step of the young Apollo when,</div>
<div class="i0">With limbs like light and golden locks toss'd back</div>
<div class="i0">On a smooth ivory shoulder, he avenged</div>
<div class="i0">His mother's wrongs on Python: the dreaming step</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>
<div class="i0">Of Hylas in the woods of Mysia</div>
<div class="i0">Leading to sleep beneath sweet sylvan waters:</div>
<div class="i0">The laughing step of untrammell'd Atalanta</div>
<div class="i0">Spurning the ground before her golden capture:</div>
<div class="i0">Child-Proserpina stepping like a flower,</div>
<div class="i0">And the singing step of Syrinx fleeing&mdash;what?</div>
<div class="i0">If thou couldst speak, neglected, sneering stone,</div>
<div class="i0">Thou wouldst know how to answer me. Wilt thou</div>
<div class="i0">Not speak?... How still it is!... The noise of the world</div>
<div class="i0">Is shut about with silence!... If I kneel,</div>
<div class="i0">Bend and adore, make sacrifice to thee,</div>
<div class="i0">If to thy long-deserted fane I bring</div>
<div class="i0">Tribute of milk and honey&mdash;then if I snap</div>
<div class="i0">That loveliest pipe of all at the spring's margin</div>
<div class="i0">And let the song of Syrinx from its hollow,</div>
<div class="i0">Nay, even the nymph's sweet self&mdash;O Pan, old Pan,</div>
<div class="i0">Shall I not see thee stirring in the stone,</div>
<div class="i0">Crack thy confinement, leap forth&mdash;<i>be</i> again?</div>
<div class="i0">I can believe it, master of bright streams,</div>
<div class="i0">Lord of green woodlands, king of sun-spread plains</div>
<div class="i0">And star-splashed hills and valleys drenched in moonlight!</div>
<div class="i0">And I shall see again a dance of Dryads</div>
<div class="i0">And airy shapes of Oreads circling free</div>
<div class="i0">To shy sweet pipings of fantastic fauns</div>
<div class="i0">And lustier-breathing satyrs ... God of Nature,</div>
<div class="i0">Thrice hailing thee by name with boisterous lungs</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
<div class="i0">I will thrill thee back from the dead ages, thus:</div>
<div class="i0"><i>Pan! Pan! O Pan! bring back thy reign again</i></div>
<div class="i0"><i>Upon the earth!</i>...</div>
<div class="i19">Numb pointed ears, ye hear</div>
<div class="i0">Only the wash and whisper of far waters,</div>
<div class="i0">The pale green waters of thin distant Springs</div>
<div class="i0">Under the pale green light of distant moons</div>
<div class="i0">Washing upon the shores of the old, old world</div>
<div class="i0">With a foam of flowers, a foam of whispering flowers....</div>

<div class="i0">Of bright aspiring fools that will not choose</div>
<div class="i0">To tread life's inconspicuous middle ways&mdash;</div>
<div class="i0">O, when we love we bring our lov'd ones woe</div>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">I had a son, his name was Phaeton.</div>
<div class="i0">Could he be of my being and not be proud?</div>
<div class="i0">He was all inspiration, and he mounted</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
<div class="i0">Up to the highest and reached his hands for the sun</div>
<div class="i0">And shouted: "I will light the fires in heaven!"</div>
<div class="i0">But he was three-parts man to one-part God,</div>
<div class="i0">So men and Gods shrugged his brief blaze of glory</div>
<div class="i0">Into extinction ... Thus I lost my son,</div>
<div class="i0">Phaeton, killed thro' overmuch ambition.</div>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">I had a son, his name was Orpheus.</div>
<div class="i0">Could he be of my being and not love?</div>
<div class="i0">His love was rooted deeplier than Hell.</div>
<div class="i0">He said: "I will pluck back my love from Hell</div>
<div class="i0">Tho' it upheave all Hell in the plucking." When</div>
<div class="i0">He failed, being one-part man to three-parts God,</div>
<div class="i0">He chose the swift way to regain his love</div>
<div class="i0">And died a vile death ... Thus I lost my son,</div>
<div class="i0">Orpheus, killed thro' too great love and longing.</div>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">I had a son. He was Asklepios,</div>
<div class="i0">Could he be of my being and not <span class="smcap">know</span>?</div>
<div class="i0">His wisdom girdled life and death in one;</div>
<div class="i0">Life smiled on him, because he smiled on death</div>
<div class="i0">And said: "Life is less conquerable than death."</div>
<div class="i0">He said: "I will reverse the word of death."</div>
<div class="i0">He said: "I will make the dead to live again."</div>
<div class="i0">Two days ago Asklepios lived ...</div>
<div class="i31">The King</div>
<div class="i0">Of the nether-world, that wears the face of night</div>
<div class="i0">And hates me, wearing day's face, called on Zeus:</div>
<div class="i0">"This mortal steals upon my sovereignty,</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
<div class="i0">Stands brazen champion for the world of flesh,</div>

<div class="i0">Worse! hales the souls back from beyond the Styx,</div>
<div class="i0">Bringing the dead to life. This is more craft,</div>
<div class="i0">Brother, than we may suffer in a man.</div>
<div class="i0">Shall he with careless finger sway at will</div>
<div class="i0">The Balance of Destiny? Avenge me, Zeus!"</div>
<div class="i0">A Cyclops forged a thunder-bolt for Zeus,</div>
<div class="i0">And, black-browed, Zeus did launch it ... Thus I lost</div>
<div class="i0">My son Asklepios, killed thro' too much knowledge.</div>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<div class="i0"><i>Asklepios! my dead Asklepios!</i></div>

<div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">Let the dark King of Stygia howl for aid</div>
<div class="i0">To Olympos! I am King of Heaven and ask</div>
<div class="i0">No aid! I wreak my vengeance for myself.</div>
<div class="i0">I rose up in the wrath of my bereavement</div>
<div class="i0">And set an arrow to the silver bow</div>
<div class="i0">That none save I can bend, and let it fly.</div>
<div class="i0">I might not slay the wielder of the bolt,</div>
<div class="i0">But I did slay the forger of the bolt.</div>
<div class="i0">And when I saw the Cyclops pierced and dead</div>
<div class="i0">I came to Zeus and told him of my deed:</div>
<div class="i0">"Father, 'gainst whom my bow was never turned,</div>
<div class="i0">Father, that hast destroyed thine own son's son,</div>
<div class="i0">I defy thy doing and have destroyed thy tool."</div>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">Then while the Gods stood all aghast, Zeus spake:</div>
<div class="i0">"Go from among this immortal company</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>
<div class="i0">Which thou hast sinned against in daring so</div>
<div class="i0">To sin against <i>me</i> that am the head of all,</div>
<div class="i0">And learn to quell thy too fierce spirit, learn</div>
<div class="i0">To teach thy riotous blood obedience,</div>
<div class="i0">Serving the sons of men one year of days.</div>
<div class="i0">Go hence! thou art not of us for twelve moons."</div>
<div class="i0">I nothing said, and went. For when we Gods</div>
<div class="i0">Revolt among ourselves the end is near,</div>
<div class="i0">And Zeus must levy justice as he will.</div>

<div class="i0">Better will I endure to learn of thee</div>
<div class="i0">Than of the envious Gods, whom this disgrace</div>
<div class="i0">Serves for a secret feast to glut their hearts on.</div>
<div class="i0">For we have loved each other, thou and I,</div>
<div class="i0">And I have belted thee with golden arms,</div>

States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm

specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any

performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project

  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has

  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal

LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR

with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
